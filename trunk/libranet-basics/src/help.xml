<title>Linux HOWTO's</title>

distribution independent, and therefore very useful for using
them with Libranet GNU/Linux.

<title>Manual pages</title>

<para>
Most Unix-like commands are covered by the a traditional *nix
help system called the manual pages. You can read the manual
page of a program by using the <command>man</command> command.
Executing <command>man</command> with the name of the command
as a parameter shows the manual page for that command. For example:
</para>

<screen>
$ <command>man ls</command>
</screen>

<para>
If you do not know the exact name of a manual page or command, you can
search a page using the keyword (<emphasis>-k</emphasis>) parameter:
</para>

<screen>
$ <command>man -k routing</command>
NETLINK_ROUTE (7)    - Linux IPv4 routing socket
netstat (8)          - Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
route (8)            - show / manipulate the IP routing table
