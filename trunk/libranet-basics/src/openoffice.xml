This chapter gives a short introduction to the OpenOffice office suite
(officially named OpenOffice.org). OpenOffice is a fairly complete replacement
for other office suites, like Microsoft Office. It offers the most commonly
used functionality, an can open most major word processing, presentation
and spreadsheet formats. OpenOffice features the following functionality:

<para>
As you can see in <xref linkend="openoffice-writer" />, the OpenOffice Writer
actually looks a lot like other word processors. So, migrating to OpenOffice
should not be too difficult for most users. Let's start to have a look at
some GUI elements:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Working area</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
The working area is where most of the action will take place. As you can
see, the working area shows the paper you are virtually typing on, and
the thin grey lines mark the border of the area you can add text to. When
you type the text will be inserted at the point the blinking cursor was
at, and the cursor will be moved forward as you type text, indicating the
current typing position. You can also add other elements, such as images,
to the working area. You probably have noticed that the working area
is truly WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Format bar</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
The format bar is used to change the appearance of your text, or parts of
your texts. There are multiple buttons and other elements that you can select,
you can see the meaning of each element by placing the mouse pointer on a
specific element. After a short time a tip will show, with a description
of the element. If you have no text selected the appearance will change
for the text that you will type after making the change. You can also change
the appearance of text that has already been typed, by selecting the text,
and making the necessary changes. You will see that the text will be altered
directly. Be aware that you can alway undo changes by using the &lt;Ctrl&gt;
+ &lt;z&gt; keys, or selecting the <emphasis>Edit -> Undo</emphasis>
menu item.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Page zoom</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
The page zoom indicator shows the zooming percentage of the document you
are currently using. If you have trouble reading smaller fonts, you can zoom
in to be able to read these fonts more comfortably. You can also zoom out
to get a better overview of a page or multiple pages. Select the
<emphasis>View -> Zoom...</emphasis> option to change the zooming percentage.
There are also three special options, most notably 
<emphasis>Optimal</emphasis>, which will zoom to an ideal percentage for
editing.
