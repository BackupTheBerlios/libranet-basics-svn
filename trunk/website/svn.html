<h1>Using SVN</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Subversion (SVN) is the version management system the Libranet Basics
project uses. With SVN multiple authors can work on the same source tree.
This page gives a short introduction to Subversion. Please be aware that
you will need a developer account to be able to use these instructions,
frequent contributors will be offered an account.
</p>

<p>
The libranet-basics repository consists of a few directories. For normal
usage only the <i>trunk</i> and <i>branches</i> directories are important.
<i>Trunk</i> is used for the current development version of the book
(at this moment <i>trunk</i> holds the book for Libranet 2.8.1).
<i>Branches</i> will hold sources for versions of the book that are
written for older Libranet versions. The 2.8.1 book will go here when
Libranet 3.0 is released. If you are contributing to the cutting-edge
of the book <i>trunk/libranet-basics</i> is the most important directory,
it holds the sources of the current version of the book.
</p>

<p>
To use Subversion, you have to install the <i>subversion</i> package
with <b>apt-get install subversion</b>.
</p>

<p>
Please, send a question to the lb-devel list if something is not completely
clear to you after reading this page. The source repository is the heart
of this project, and we'd like to keep the amount of screw-ups to the 
minimum ;).
</p>

<h2>Checking out the sources</h2>

<p>
The first thing you have to do is to get a source snapshot of the book. You
only have to do this once, you can update this snapshot infinitely ;).
Checking out the sources is really easy with the following two commands:
</p>

<p>
<tt>
export SVN_SSH="ssh -l yourloginname"
svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/libranet-basics
</tt>
</p>

<p>
After executing these commands the sources will be available in
<i>libranet-basics/</i>.
</p>

<h2>Updating your checkout</h2>

<p>
You will have to update your local checkout regularly to get the changes
other people made. This can be done easily by entering the following command
in the top-level directory (<i>libranet-basics</i>) of your checkout:
</p>

<p>
<tt>
svn update
</tt>
</p>

<h2>Committing changes</h2>

<p>
The most fun part is, of course, committing your own changes ;). Please
make sure that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>you do a <b>svn update</b> before committing to make sure nobody else
has worked on the same file,</li>
<li>you explicitly specify the files you want to commit, because SVN will
commit all changed files when you don't!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, on to the commit command:
</p>

<p>
<tt>
svn commit -m "Description of the commit." file1 file2 ... filen
</tt>
</p>

<p>
Be sure to use a short, but useful description of the commit. For example:
</p>

<p>
<tt>
svn commit -m "Added a section about changing process priorities." proc.xml
</tt>
</p>
